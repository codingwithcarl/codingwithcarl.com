Hello there!

You're reading my very first blog post. Ever. I plan on using this section of my site to host my developer notes and write about anything that I'm interested in. A lot of it will be pulled from other resources, and I will cite those sources as they come up.

I have some ideas of what to put out in the future:

- Linux
- Docker
- Microservices
- AWS

I hope you enjoy the content I put out and hopefully you'll learn something new.
