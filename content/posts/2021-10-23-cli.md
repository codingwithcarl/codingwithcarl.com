## File Operations

**pwd:** print working directory... outputs current absolute path

**cd:** change directory

**ls:** list directory contents

**mkdir:** make directory

**touch:** create a file

**cp:** copy

**rm:** remove... delete a file

**rm -rf:** remove recursive force... delete a directory and it's contents

**cat:** concatenate files / print content of file on the standard output

**diff:** show the difference between two files

**locate:** find files by name (use -i to ignore case)

**find:** search for files in a directory hierarchy

**zip, unzip:** compress / uncompress files in a zip archive

**tail -f:** output the last part of files and follow the appended data as the file grows

- log files are the main use case

**tar:** an archiving utility

> archive multiple files into a **tarball** â€” a common Linux file format that is similar to zip format, with compression being optional.

Extract a gzipped tarball:

```bash
tar -xvzf tarballname.tar.gz
```

> ```
> -x --extract = extract files from an archive
> -v, --verbose = verbosely list files processed
> -z, --gzip = gzipped files eg. for tar.gz packages
> -f, --file ARCHIVE = use archive file or device ARCHIVE
> ```

**chmod:** change the read, write, and execute permissions of files and directories

**chown:** change or transfer the ownership of a file to the specified username

**sed:** commonly used for find and replace tasks

- Example: find and replace (first instance on every line):

```bash
sed 's/find/replace' <oldfile >newfile
```

- Global find/replace (replaces every instance on every line in a file):

```bash
sed "s/c/C/g" filename
```

- Write directly to the file:

```bash
sed -i '' filename.txt
```

**grep:** searches for *PATTERNS* in each *FILE*. *PATTERNS* is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.

- Example:

```bash
grep 'string' path/to/file
```

'string', [list], ^linestart,

- Exact match:

```bash
grep -w 'string' filename
```

## Network Connectivity

**wget:** the non-interactive network downloader... pass in a link to download a file

**curl:** transfer a URL.. transfer data to/from servers, with many more options than only HTTP/HTTPS

**ping:** send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts... check your connectivity status to a server

**ssh:** OpenSSH remote client login. Remote into servers on a network

**scp:** secure file copy. copies files between hosts on a network

**hostname -i:** displays hostname and IP address
